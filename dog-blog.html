  <h1>Best Dogs List</h1>
  <h2>I've got a bunch of dogs I like but this is a list that narrows it down to 3 and my explinations behind them.</h2>
  <h3>Dogs</h3>
  <p>Top 3</p>
  <ul>
    <liv>Huskey</liv>
     <p>I love huskeys because they're the perfect snow dogs. They can pull you on your snowboard and run along side you. They're energetic, happy, and just looks awesome.</p>
    <liv>Pitbull</liv>
     <p>Pitbulls are on this list because of the presence they bring. They're one of the scariest but sweetest dogs, and I've always thought having one would be super fun and also cool in generall because of their stature.</p>
    <Liv>Golden Retreiver</Liv>
     <p>Golden Retreivers are just the best family dog you could own. I'd want to get one of these once I'm older and have a family because they bring so much energy and excitment to the table and they're super soft around kids.</p>
  </ul>
<p>Thanks for reading my list on my I think these three dogs are the best dogs out there.</p>
